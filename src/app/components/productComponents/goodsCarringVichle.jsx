          Commercial Vehicle Insurance is a motor insurance that protects
          vehicles from financial risk â€“ an external damage such as natural
          disasters, accidents, thefts, fire and third-party liabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Motor Vehicles Act of 1988, requires all vehicles including
          goods-carrying vehicles to have Third-Party (TP) damage insurance
          coverage because their large size and heavy loads make them vulnerable
          to various hazards during transportation.
